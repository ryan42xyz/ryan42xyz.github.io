<p>The essence of investment is not finding the highest returns, but constructing a sustainable compounding system under structural constraints.</p>
<h2 id="I-Opening-A-Highly-Counterintuitive-Recommendation">I. Opening: A Highly Counterintuitive Recommendation</h2>
<p>Buffett left a very simple will allocation:</p>
<p>90% S&amp;P 500 index fund<br>
10% US short-term treasury bonds</p>
<p>This is often quoted but rarely truly understood.</p>
<p>What’s truly worth thinking about is not:</p>
<p>Why is the S&amp;P good?</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>Why would someone who spent a lifetime actively investing ultimately leave their descendants an extremely passive, even somewhat “boring” solution?</p>
<p>If active investing is truly superior long-term, why not entrust the family’s future to active strategies?</p>
<p>If markets can be consistently beaten, why not allocate to top fund managers?</p>
<p>Behind this paradox lies a more fundamental question:</p>
<p>What is the true essence of investment?</p>
<p>Is it pursuing maximum returns? Or constructing a system that can exist long-term and compound continuously?</p>
<h2 id="II-The-Essence-of-Investment-and-Real-Constraints">II. The Essence of Investment and Real Constraints</h2>
<p>Setting aside all financial concepts, investment systems are constrained by only four variables:</p>
<p>Principal, return rate, time, risk (hidden variable)</p>
<p>The real formula should be written as:</p>
<p><strong>Achievable Wealth = Principal Size × Sustainable Return Rate × Duration × Survival Probability</strong></p>
<p>Note the key word here: <strong>Sustainable return rate</strong>. Not maximum return rate.</p>
<p>Because compounding has only one premise: <strong>must continue to exist</strong>.</p>
<p>Any single system interruption—blowout, major loss followed by exit, long-term departure, institutional collapse—will reset compounding to zero.</p>
<p>So what investment truly optimizes is not returns, but: <strong>long-term compounding under sufficiently high survival probability</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="III-Survival-vs-Return-Model">III. Survival vs Return Model</h2>
<p>Imagine a two-dimensional coordinate:</p>
<p>X-axis: Return rate<br>
Y-axis: Long-term survival probability</p>
<p>As return rate increases, volatility increases, drawdowns increase, uncertainty increases, investable principal decreases, long-term survival probability decreases.</p>
<p>Therefore, there exists a counterintuitive relationship: <strong>Higher return rates lead to lower long-term survival probability</strong>.</p>
<p>The true goal of investment is not maximizing return, but <strong>maximizing survival-adjusted return</strong>—that is, achieving the highest possible compounding under sufficiently high survival probability.</p>
<p>This is not an operational formula, but a cognitive framework. It changes the evaluation criteria for investment decisions: from “return maximization” to “survival-adjusted return maximization”.</p>
<h2 id="IV-Principal–Risk–Time-Triangle-Structure">IV. Principal–Risk–Time Triangle Structure</h2>
<p>Any long-term investment system is locked by a triangular relationship:</p>
<p><strong>Principal, Risk, Time</strong></p>
<p>The three have rigid constraints:</p>
<p><strong>1) Higher risk → Less investable principal</strong></p>
<p>You won’t put all assets into high-uncertainty strategies. Therefore, high-return assets often cannot be heavily weighted.</p>
<p>Conclusion: <strong>High returns ≠ High total returns</strong>. Because principal cannot be heavily weighted long-term.</p>
<p>A simple mathematical intuition: If high-return assets can only allocate 10% principal at 20% annualized, while S&amp;P 500 can allocate 100% principal at 8% annualized, then total returns are: High-return assets = 10% × 20% = 2%, S&amp;P 500 = 100% × 8% = 8%. Even though high-return assets have 2.5× the return rate of S&amp;P 500, total returns are only 1/4 of S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p><strong>2) Higher risk → Shorter duration</strong></p>
<p>Typical outcomes of high-volatility strategies: blowout, panic exit, strategy switching. Compounding is interrupted.</p>
<p><strong>3) Longer time → Must reduce risk</strong></p>
<p>To persist for 30–40 years, must rely on assets that can survive long-term, not high-volatility opportunistic assets.</p>
<p>Together, these three constitute the unbreakable structural boundary of investment.</p>
<h2 id="V-The-Participation-Barrier-Paradox-of-the-Investment-Industry">V. The Participation Barrier Paradox of the Investment Industry</h2>
<p>Investment is the only industry where professionals and non-professionals compete at the same table.</p>
<p>Medicine, aviation, chip design, high-frequency trading—these industries have clear participation barriers. Non-professionals cannot participate.</p>
<p>But capital markets are different: everyone operates in the same market pricing system.</p>
<p>For non-professional investors, the real cost of active investing is not losses, but <strong>opportunity cost</strong>.</p>
<p>For most people, career compounding &gt; investment compounding.</p>
<p>Therefore, passive long-term investing is not the “return optimal solution,” but the “<strong>opportunity cost optimal solution</strong>”.</p>
<h2 id="VI-Why-8-Is-the-Hardest-Return-Rate-for-Humans-to-Maintain">VI. Why ~8% Is the Hardest Return Rate for Humans to Maintain</h2>
<p>~8% difficulty is not in achieving, but in persisting.</p>
<p>In bull markets: Others gain 40% in a year, you only have 8%, strategy looks foolish.</p>
<p>In bear markets: Assets drawdown 30%, long-term logic is questioned, most exit here.</p>
<p>The true premise for compounding: Must invest sufficient principal and hold long-term without moving. This is psychologically extremely difficult.</p>
<p>So reality is: Many have achieved 30% in a year, very few have achieved 8% for 20 consecutive years.</p>
<p>~8% sits in the sustainable compounding zone—higher than this is hard to heavily weight or sustain long-term, lower than this is insufficient compounding, it’s right at the intersection of human psychology and market returns. This is not financial analysis, but an insight about human nature: difficulty is in persistence, not achievement.</p>
<h2 id="VII-Convergence-Dynamics-Mechanism">VII. Convergence Dynamics Mechanism</h2>
<p>When all the above constraints are considered, long-term investment logic naturally converges to one asset type: can exist long-term, sufficient returns, bearable risk, allows heavy weighting, sustainable for decades.</p>
<p><strong>Convergence is not a choice, but being pushed back by constraints.</strong></p>
<p>When non-professional investors attempt active investing, they encounter: high opportunity cost, low success rate, high psychological burden. These constraints naturally push them back to the default solution.</p>
<p><strong>Convergence is the result of constraints, not choice.</strong></p>
<h2 id="VIII-Why-Long-Term-Logic-Converges-to-the-S-P-500">VIII. Why Long-Term Logic Converges to the S&amp;P 500</h2>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 happens to satisfy this set of harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its core value is not highest returns, but: allows you to put sufficient principal into a system that won’t easily kick you out, and persist for decades.</p>
<p>This is the key.</p>
<p>But need to clarify: <strong>S&amp;P 500 = default solution, not optimal solution</strong>.</p>
<p>In current human financial history, it’s one of the most stable default solutions. There may be better choices, but the default solution is already sufficient.</p>
<h2 id="IX-Why-the-S-P-500-Not-Other-Indices">IX. Why the S&amp;P 500, Not Other Indices?</h2>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 became the global long-term investment anchor not because America is special, but because it has the most complete capital market historical sample.</p>
<p>Truly continuous modern stock market data begins in 1926. This is when US capital markets first had systematic, continuous, reproducible market data.</p>
<p>Before this: data scattered, unstable composition, inconsistent systems, lacking long-term comparability.</p>
<p>Therefore: <strong>1926 = starting point of modern capital markets statistics</strong>.</p>
<p>When people say “S&amp;P long-term annualized ~9–10%”, they mean <strong>Total Return</strong>—that is, price growth + dividend reinvestment. If only calculating price, long-term annualized would be ~1.5–2% lower.</p>
<p>This means: an important source of long-term compounding is not continuous price appreciation, but <strong>continuous dividend reinvestment</strong>.</p>
<p>Different starting points yield vastly different results: Starting 2000 → near-zero returns, Starting 2009 → extremely high returns, Starting 1970s → high returns.</p>
<p>Therefore “S&amp;P annualized X%” is always the result of interval selection + reinvestment assumptions.</p>
<p>But nearly 100 years of samples already cover: Great Depression, wars, high inflation, tech revolution, financial crises—almost all macro extreme scenarios.</p>
<p>Therefore it’s not a prediction tool, but a <strong>structural anchor</strong>: the order of magnitude of returns that equity assets can provide long-term in mature capital markets where institutions haven’t collapsed.</p>
<p>It describes the structural boundary of asset returns.</p>
<p>The value of historical samples is not in proving appreciation, but in covering complete cycles. Even if historical performance is poor (like Japanese stock market), historical samples still have value, because they prove the structural fact that “long-term returns can be very low”.</p>
<h2 id="X-The-Irreversibility-of-Compounding-Interruption">X. The Irreversibility of Compounding Interruption</h2>
<p>Need to emphasize: <strong>Compounding interruption is not “pause,” but “reset to zero”</strong>.</p>
<p>Once compounding is interrupted—blowout, exit, institutional collapse—previous compounding disappears. This is not “pause,” but irreversible loss.</p>
<p>This explains why “continued existence” is more important than “high returns”.</p>
<p>Any single system interruption will reset compounding to zero.</p>
<h2 id="XI-Compounding-Belongs-to-Systems-Not-Smart-People">XI. Compounding Belongs to Systems, Not Smart People</h2>
<p>This doesn’t mean intelligence is unimportant, but that: in long-term compounding, <strong>system sustainability (won’t interrupt) is more important than individual intelligence (short-term high returns)</strong>.</p>
<p>Intelligence can give you high returns, but only systems can give you continuous compounding.</p>
<p>Compounding only belongs to systems that can stay at the table long-term.</p>
<h2 id="XII-Full-Text-Conclusion">XII. Full Text Conclusion</h2>
<p>The essence of investment is not finding maximum returns.</p>
<p>It’s putting sufficient principal into a system that can exist long-term.</p>
<p>Let time be the only variable that needs to work.</p>
<p><strong>Only discussing: long-term compounding systems in mature capital markets where institutions haven’t collapsed.</strong></p>
<p>Compounding doesn’t belong to smart people.</p>
<p><strong>Compounding only belongs to systems that can stay at the table long-term.</strong></p>
